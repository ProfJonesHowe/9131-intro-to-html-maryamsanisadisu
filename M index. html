<title>Kpop demon Hunters is the best!!</title>
<body>
	<Hl>The Kpop superstars</H1>
	<H2>This is why I love the movie</H2>
	<p> The superstars Rumi,Mira and zoey are using their secret identities as demon Hunters to protect their fans from the demons, a boy band, who in my opinion are so cute.
		but they are their rivals. for me the movie offers alot of great explanation and reasurrance that your insecurities do not make you who you are. the animation is stunning. 
		there are some twist in the show, but the best twists ive seen before.
